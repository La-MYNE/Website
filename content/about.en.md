# An interdisciplinary community for sustainable living

La Myne provides access to an open space in the heart of the Rhone-Alpes region, gathering the functions of a **hacklab** - *open community laboratory* - **fablab** - *laboratory / workshop* - et d’espace de co-working - *shared workspace and network* - serving experimentation and development of bio-inspired projects within a logic of sustainability.

The ambition of La Myne is to be a natural platform for sharing, collaboration and co-construction of sustainable solutions in the service of civil society. Combining all types of citizens reflections, La Myne projects, whether personal or collective, are at the interface between art, technology, science and society.

The Myne aims to extend the reappropriation of research based on the philosophy of DIY and by extension the Do It Together. Join La Myne to reclaim yourself to experiment on such complex subjects as those related to the living, to digital, or social aspects.
What drives us? Do it ! Following the adage of Nelson Mandela: "It always seems impossible until it’s done." the community is experimenting with new forms of organizations and innovative technical systems ... So what are we waiting for? YOU! Do it yourself TOGETHER!

## A mode of open governance
Since December 2015, La Myne has dissolved its’ traditional board for a more open and democratic governance model, the College Board. Each member and anyone curious are invited to join the monthly meetings of the College Board to contribute to La Myne project. To meet on operational issues, a group meets every week around the Brain Trust and various work groups were formed to develop further activities.
